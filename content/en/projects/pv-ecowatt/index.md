Project carried out at **ECOWATT (Agadir)**.  
The objective was to simulate and optimize a grid-connected photovoltaic system
using **PVSYST**.

Completed tasks:

- Full energy simulation in PVSYST  
- Annual energy production estimation  
- Techno-economic analysis (CAPEX, OPEX, payback)  
- Technical recommendations and improved PV system design

This project focuses on the modelling of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT)
using **QBlade**. The BEMT method was applied to evaluate lift, drag, and
performance coefficients.  
Blade geometry was optimized to improve the overall turbine efficiency.

The work includes:

- Full aerodynamic analysis  
- Power and performance curves  
- Stability evaluation  
- Blade profile optimization

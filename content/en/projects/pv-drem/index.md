Project completed at the **Regional Directorate of Energy and Mines (Agadir)**.  
The study focuses on designing a hybrid photovoltaic system (off-grid + grid)
to supply a variable-load installation.

Work includes:

- Electrical load analysis  
- PV and battery sizing  
- Hybrid system evaluation  
- Production and autonomy optimization
